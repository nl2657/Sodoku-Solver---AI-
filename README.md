# Sodoku-Solver---AI-
AI program that can solve many Soduku boards in a very short time

rogram executes as follows:
$python3 sudoku.py <input string>

In the starter zip, sudokus start.txt, contains hundreds of sample unsolved Sudoku boards, and sudokus finish.txt
the corresponding solutions. Each board is represented as a single line of text, starting from the top-left corner of
the board, and listed left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

The first board in sudokus start.txt is represented as the string:
003020600900305001001806400008102900700000008006708200002609500800203009005010300

Which is equivalent to:
0 0 3 0 2 0 6 0 0
9 0 0 3 0 5 0 0 1
0 0 1 8 0 6 4 0 0
0 0 8 1 0 2 9 0 0
7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8
0 0 6 7 0 8 2 0 0
0 0 2 6 0 9 5 0 0
8 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 9
0 0 5 0 1 0 3 0 0
the program will generate output.txt, containing a single line of text representing the finished Sudoku board.
